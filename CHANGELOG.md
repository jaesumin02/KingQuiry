Notable project changes are recorded here in reverse chronological order.

## 2026-10-17

- Simplified customer land estimates to one context-aware action button that
  stays available beside the always-visible fields; results and errors appear
  inside the calculator without moving the chat transcript. Removed the
  redundant Customer Chat header link so the admin dashboard's Customer inbox
  shortcut is the single page entry point.
- Clarified database setup: `database/schema.sql` is the single import for a
  fresh install and already creates/seeds the location directory.
  `database/location_schema.sql` remains only for upgrading legacy databases
  that lack the structured location fields.
- Changed the Admin Customer Chat inbox into an accessible floating bubble
  with a collapsible conversation list and reply panel, so the chat remains a
  bubble on the page tested by administrators as well as on client pages.
- Added live admin business analytics with verified sale totals, an always
  visible six-month actual monthly revenue line graph, top-selling properties,
  and a separately labeled
  active-pipeline asking-price estimate. Staff must enter the verified agreed
  sale price to complete a transaction; legacy records are not assigned
  invented prices.
- Added an idempotent migration for the actual sale-price field and included it
  in the fresh-install schema. The customer chat remains a floating bubble on
  the public catalog, property details, and client dashboard. Documented that
  the comparable-listing price estimator is data-based, not a trained ML model.
- Changed the guest navigation label from "Login" to "Sign in" to match the
  English sign-in page wording.
- Made client transaction tracking easier to find with a direct dashboard link,
  a mobile-friendly vertical update timeline, a prominent latest update, and a
  clear browse-properties action when the client has no requests to track.
- Added the floating customer chat bubble to the client dashboard as well as
  the catalog and property detail pages.
- Added client-visible real-estate transaction tracking from inquiry/viewing
  through negotiation, reservation, document and payment confirmation, and
  successful completion. Staff updates are ordered, timestamped, attributed to
  the updater, and require verification notes for payment and successful
  completion. Related inquiry/viewing submissions share an open case reference.
- Added an Admin/Sales Agent transaction tracker, synchronized viewing approval
  and cancellation with the client timeline, and added privacy-safe schema and
  an existing-record backfill migration without inventing earlier history.
- Documented the tracking workflow, its manual-verification and no-payment/GPS
  limitations, and the database migration required on existing installations.
- Replaced the public chat text button with an accessible floating chat bubble,
  a responsive animated panel, keyboard dismissal, and polling only while the
  conversation panel is open. The launcher label now tracks the open/closed
  state for assistive technology.
- Added administrator controls to add verified region/province/city locations
  and deactivate/reactivate them without deleting location records referenced
  by properties. Location options now flow dynamically to listings, catalog
  filters, and estimate forms.
- Consolidated the admin location directory read into a single database query
  and clarified catalog wording for locations beyond the initial Batangas seed.
- Corrected the region-code input pattern for current browser regular-expression
  validation so the location form remains warning-free.
- Expanded setup documentation for portable installation, custom location
  setup, first-admin provisioning, privacy-safe database transfer, image files,
  CDN connectivity, and runtime requirements.
- Prevented cached login/authenticated pages from presenting stale content
  after browser Back navigation. The login page reloads when restored from the
  back-forward cache; a still-active session is redirected to its role-based
  dashboard.
- Added this README covering the current pages, roles, main features, local
  setup, database expectations, and maintenance/security notes.
- Added a user-level Copilot instruction requesting dated changelog entries for
  future code changes across workspaces.
- Added a rule-based customer chat widget on the catalog and property detail
  pages, with automatic greetings and offline replies, client conversations,
  and admin replies in a new admin inbox.
- Replaced the demo average-times-factor estimator with a shared weighted
  comparable-listing estimator and indicative +/-10% price range for the admin
  dashboard and customer chat.
- Added the SQL schema migration required by chat and updated setup and feature
  documentation.
- Applied a consistent responsive design system and refreshed catalog,
  account, admin, agent, client, and property-detail screens.
- Added a normalized Batangas municipality directory and structured property
  location fields while retaining existing free-text location values.
- Added verified land-area entry, automatic per-square-meter pricing,
  location/category-aware robust estimates, and optional validated property
  image uploads.
- Hardened authentication, account/property form validation, appointment
  requests, CSRF protection, database configuration, and the password-reset
  utility; fixed legacy `Agent` role routing.
- Added a complete fresh-install `database/schema.sql` for all current tables
  and the Batangas location directory, without copying private/local records.
- Reworked dashboard charts to aggregate all property categories and request
  statuses from the database, group unexpected legacy values, provide accurate
  counts and empty states, and work without an external chart library.
